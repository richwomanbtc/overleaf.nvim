# overleaf.nvim

Neovim plugin for real-time collaborative LaTeX editing on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com).

Edit your Overleaf projects directly in Neovim with full real-time collaboration support via Operational Transformation (OT).

## Features

- **Real-time collaboration** — edits sync instantly with other Overleaf users via OT
- **File tree** — browse and manage project files in a sidebar
- **Auto-authentication** — extracts session cookie from Chrome automatically
- **Auto-reconnect** — recovers from disconnects and document restores seamlessly
- **Compile & PDF preview** — compile LaTeX and open the PDF
- **Comments & reviews** — view, reply, resolve comment threads
- **Collaborator cursors** — see where other users are editing
- **Project-wide search** — grep across all documents
- **File management** — create, delete, rename, upload files
- **History** — view project version history
- **Diagnostics** — chktex linter + LaTeX compile errors via `vim.diagnostic`
- **LSP support** — auto-attaches texlab, ltex, harper_ls to overleaf buffers

## Requirements

- Neovim >= 0.10
- Node.js >= 18
- An [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) account
- Chrome / Chromium (for automatic cookie extraction) or a session cookie

## Installation

### lazy.nvim

```lua
{
  'your-username/overleaf.nvim',
  config = function()
    require('overleaf').setup()
  end,
  build = 'cd node && npm install',
}
```

### Manual

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/overleaf.nvim ~/.local/share/nvim/lazy/overleaf.nvim
cd ~/.local/share/nvim/lazy/overleaf.nvim/node && npm install
```

## Authentication

### Option 1: Chrome (automatic)

Just log in to [overleaf.com](https://www.overleaf.com) in Chrome. The plugin extracts the session cookie automatically. If you have multiple Chrome profiles, you'll be prompted to select one.

### Option 2: Manual cookie

Create a `.env` file in your working directory:

```
OVERLEAF_COOKIE=your_overleaf_session2_cookie_here
```

Or pass it directly in setup:

```lua
require('overleaf').setup({
  cookie = 'your_overleaf_session2_cookie_here',
})
```

To get the cookie manually: open overleaf.com in your browser → DevTools → Application → Cookies → copy the full `Cookie` header value.

## Usage

### Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `:Overleaf` | Connect (or show status if connected) |
| `:Overleaf connect` | Connect to Overleaf |
| `:Overleaf disconnect` | Disconnect |
| `:Overleaf compile` | Compile LaTeX project |
| `:Overleaf tree` | Toggle file tree |
| `:Overleaf open` | Open a document |
| `:Overleaf projects` | Switch project |
| `:Overleaf status` | Show connection status |
| `:Overleaf preview` | Preview binary file (images, etc.) |
| `:Overleaf new [name]` | Create new document |
| `:Overleaf mkdir [name]` | Create new folder |
| `:Overleaf delete` | Delete file/folder |
| `:Overleaf rename` | Rename file/folder |
| `:Overleaf upload [path]` | Upload local file |
| `:Overleaf search [pattern]` | Search across all documents |
| `:Overleaf comments` | List all comments |
| `:Overleaf comments refresh` | Refresh comments from server |
| `:Overleaf history` | View project history |

### Default Keymaps

| Key | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `<leader>oc` | Connect |
| `<leader>od` | Disconnect |
| `<leader>ob` | Build (compile) |
| `<leader>ot` | Toggle file tree |
| `<leader>oo` | Open document picker |
| `<leader>op` | Preview file |
| `<leader>or` | Read comment at cursor |
| `<leader>oR` | Reply to comment |
| `<leader>ox` | Resolve/reopen comment |
| `<leader>of` | Find in project (search) |

### Tree Keymaps

| Key | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `Enter` | Open document |
| `a` | New document |
| `A` | New folder |
| `d` | Delete |
| `r` | Rename |
| `u` | Upload file |
| `R` | Refresh tree |
| `q` | Close tree |

## Configuration

```lua
require('overleaf').setup({
  -- Path to .env file containing OVERLEAF_COOKIE (default: '.env')
  env_file = '.env',

  -- Session cookie (overrides .env)
  cookie = nil,

  -- Path to Node.js binary (default: 'node')
  node_path = 'node',

  -- Log level: 'debug', 'info', 'warn', 'error' (default: 'info')
  log_level = 'info',

  -- Set to false to disable default keymaps
  keys = true,
})
```

## Workflow

1. `:Overleaf` — authenticate and select a project
2. File tree appears — press `Enter` to open a document
3. Edit normally — changes sync to Overleaf in real-time
4. `:w` — triggers compile and opens PDF
5. `:Overleaf tree` — switch between documents

## How It Works

The plugin spawns a Node.js bridge process that connects to Overleaf's real-time collaboration server via Socket.IO. Edits in Neovim are converted to OT operations and sent to the server. Remote edits from other collaborators are transformed and applied to your buffer in real-time.

## Acknowledgments

This project was developed with reference to the following projects for understanding Overleaf's real-time collaboration protocol:

- [AirLatex.vim](https://github.com/dmadisetti/AirLatex.vim) (MIT) — Neovim plugin for Overleaf by David Hartmann. Referenced for Chrome cookie extraction approach and Socket.IO connection patterns.
- [Overleaf-Workshop](https://github.com/iamhyc/Overleaf-Workshop) (AGPL-3.0) — VS Code extension for Overleaf. Referenced for protocol details including the v2 connection scheme, OT update hashing, and joinDoc parameters.

The code in this repository is an independent implementation in Lua/Node.js. No source code was directly copied from either project.
